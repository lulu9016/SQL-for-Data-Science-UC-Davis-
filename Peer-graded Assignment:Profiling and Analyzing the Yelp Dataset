Data Scientist Role Play: Profiling and Analyzing the Yelp Dataset Coursera Worksheet

This is a 2-part assignment. In the first part, you are asked a series of questions that will help you profile 
and understand the data just like a data scientist would. For this first part of the assignment, you will be 
assessed both on the correctness of your findings, as well as the code you used to arrive at your answer. 
You will be graded on how easy your code is to read, so remember to use proper formatting and comments where necessary.

In the second part of the assignment, you are asked to come up with your own inferences and analysis of the 
data for a particular research question you want to answer. You will be required to prepare the dataset for 
the analysis you choose to do. As with the first part, you will be graded, in part, on how easy your code is 
to read, so use proper formatting and comments to illustrate and communicate your intent as required.

For both parts of this assignment, use this "worksheet." It provides all the questions you are being asked, 
and your job will be to transfer your answers and SQL coding where indicated into this worksheet so that your 
peers can review your work. You should be able to use any Text Editor (Windows Notepad, Apple TextEdit, Notepad ++, 
Sublime Text, etc.) to copy and paste your answers. If you are going to use Word or some other page layout 
application, just be careful to make sure your answers and code are lined appropriately.

In this case, you may want to save as a PDF to ensure your formatting remains intact for you reviewer.



Part 1: Yelp Dataset Profiling and Understanding

1. Profile the data by finding the total number of records for each of the tables below:
	
i. Attribute table = 10000
ii. Business table = 10000
iii. Category table = 10000
iv. Checkin table = 10000
v. elite_years table = 10000
vi. friend table = 10000
vii. hours table = 10000
viii. photo table = 10000
ix. review table = 10000
x. tip table = 10000
xi. user table = 10000
	
---------------------------------
select count (*)
from TableName
---------------------------------

2. Find the total distinct records by either the foreign key or primary key for each table. 
If two foreign keys are listed in the table, please specify which foreign key.

i. Business = 10000 with PK in id
ii. Hours = 1562 with FK in business_id
iii. Category = 2643 with FK in business_id
iv. Attribute = 1115 with FK in business_id
v. Review = 10000 with PK in id
vi. Checkin = 493 with FK in business_id
vii. Photo = 10000 with PK in id; 6493 with FK in business_id
viii. Tip = 537 with FK in user_id; 3979 with FK in business_id
ix. User = 10000 with PK in id
x. Friend = 11 with FK in user_id
xi. Elite_years = 2780 with FK in user_id

Note: Primary Keys are denoted in the ER-Diagram with a yellow key icon.	



3. Are there any columns with null values in the Users table? Indicate "yes," or "no."

i. Do the two groups you chose to analyze have a different distribution of hours?

Toronto,restaurants
Overall, 2-3 star restaurants has opened everyday in the week and longer average opening hours while
4-5 satrs restaurants group may only open from wednesday to sunday with shorter hours. 
To be noticed, 4-5 stars restaurants prefer to open in the evening whearas 2-3 star restaurants always 
open full day.

ii. Do the two groups you chose to analyze have a different number of reviews?

+-------+---------------------+
| stars | sum(b.review_count) |
+-------+---------------------+
|   2.0 |                   5 |
|   3.0 |                  81 |
|   3.5 |                   3 |
|   4.0 |                 172 |
|   4.5 |                  34 |
+-------+---------------------+

Overall, 4-5 stars restaurants in Toronto have more reviews than 2-3 stars restaurants in Toronto.   
         
iii. Are you able to infer anything from the location data provided between these two groups? Explain.

This is difficult to infer accuracy solution for the location because sql may not able to generate a map 
plot to show where location has more 2-3 stars restaurants whereas other location has more 4-5 stars 
restaurants in Toronto.

From the sample we got, downtown and Entertainment District may have more 2-3 stars restaurants whereas 
Niagara, High Park and Etobicoke may have more 4-5 stars restaurants in Toronto.

SQL code used for analysis:

select b.name, b.city, b.stars, b.review_count, b.neighborhood, h.hours
from business b 
inner join category c on b.id = c.business_id
join hours h on b.id = h.business_id
where c.category = 'Restaurants' and city = 'Toronto' and hours like '%Saturday%'
order by b.stars;

select b.stars, sum(b.review_count)
from business b inner join category c on b.id = c.business_id
where c.category = 'Restaurants' and city = 'Toronto'
group by b.stars
having b.stars between 2 and 5 and b.stars != 3.5
order by b.stars;
		
		
2. Group business based on the ones that are open and the ones that are closed. What differences 
can you find between the ones that are still open and the ones that are closed? List at least two 
differences and the SQL code you used to arrive at your answer.

+----------------------+---------------+-----------------+---------+
| count(distinct b.id) | average_stars | average_reviews | is_open |
+----------------------+---------------+-----------------+---------+
|                 1520 |          3.52 |            23.2 |       0 |
|                 8480 |          3.68 |           31.76 |       1 |
+----------------------+---------------+-----------------+---------+

i. Difference 1:
   open: average_reviews  = 31.76
   close: average_reviews = 23.2
         
ii. Difference 2:
    open: average_stars  = 3.68
    close: average_stars = 3.52
         
SQL code used for analysis:
select count(distinct b.id), round(avg(b.stars),2) as average_stars, 
round(avg(b.review_count),2) as average_reviews, b.is_open
from business b
group by b.is_open

3. For this last part of your analysis, you are going to choose the type of analysis you want to conduct 
on the Yelp dataset and are going to prepare the data for analysis.

Ideas for analysis include: Parsing out keywords and business attributes for sentiment analysis, clustering 
businesses to find commonalities or anomalies between them, predicting the overall star rating for a business,
